Project Scope: 

This project involves the design and development of a database to store and manage HDB carpark–related data in Singapore. The database is intended to support analysis and simulations for HDB carparks only, and does not include other parking types such as street parking, shopping malls, commercial buildings, or private carparks.

The scope of the project focuses on modeling and managing HDB carpark data based on the specified requirements, with additional design suggestions included where appropriate and within scope.

Note: The full SQL code, database schema, and query implementations are documented in detail within the accompanying lab report.
